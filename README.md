🔐 Basic Password Strength Checker (C Project)
📌 Project Title

Basic Password Strength Checker

👩‍🎓 Student Details

Name: Juhi Kumari

Registration No: RU-25-10629

Program: P24

Language Used: C

🎯 Project Aim

The aim of this project is to create a Basic Password Strength Checker that validates a user’s password by checking:

Minimum password length

Presence of at least one digit

Presence of at least one uppercase letter

❓ Why This Project Is Created

In today’s digital world, password security is very important.
Weak passwords can easily be hacked.
This project is created to understand basic password validation logic and to help users create stronger and safer passwords.

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

Programming Language: C

Strings (Character Arrays)

Loops (for loop)

Conditional Statements (if-else)

Functions

String Traversal

⚙️ How the Project Works (Logic)

User enters a password

Password is passed to a validation function

Function checks:

Password length (minimum 8 characters)

At least one digit (0–9)

At least one uppercase letter (A–Z)

If all conditions are satisfied → Password is Valid

Otherwise → Password is Invalid

✅ Utility of the Project

Helps users understand how strong passwords are created

Can be used in login systems

Useful for beginners to learn real-world validation logic

Improves basic security awareness

🚀 Future Scope

This project can be enhanced by adding:

Special character validation (@, #, $, etc.)

Lowercase letter checking

Password strength levels (Weak / Medium / Strong)

GUI-based interface

Integration with real login systems
